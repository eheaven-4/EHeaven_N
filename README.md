EHeaven is a web-based student management platform to inspect and monitor academic and non-academic progress of students over the years. Basically, this is a platform that will allow a more interactive way to connect teachers, students, a principal with parents.

Here, we build an effortless way of student-teacher-parent communication covering almost all academic and non-academic related aspects over the years.
